#### How do we ensure no one loses money? 

##### Proof of stake.

Settlers, Buyers, and Sellers need to have a stake in the platform to carry out their functionalities.

Punishment and rewards.

If any of these parties are found trying to cheat their stake will be slashed. Profit on trades will be much higher on decentralized platforms due to lower charges. 

##### Kyc & Reputation System

All parties will perform some sort of web3 KYC. Examples are Gitcoin passport, email verification, social media verification etc... World coin can be added later. 

Good behavior will be rewarded with a reputation system in place. Parties involved in every successful trade will receive a reputation increase. 

We can put all of this in something called the social score. You will require a certain amount of social score to be any of these participants. For example, completing KYC will increase your social score to a certain level before you can start doing any trade. 

Also, your social score will determine the trade volume.
We can have various mechanisms around these.

#### Settler

1. They secure the protocol by settling transaction disputes and getting rewarded for that. 

2. They have to stake a certain amount to ensure that they are truthful. If any untruthfulness is detected they will be slashed. 

3. We can have an extra layer where after settlers give their dispute, the protocol dao will review before passing. 

#### Buyer

1. They will need to have a certain deposit locked on the contract in addition to their stake. For example, a buyer can take orders up to half of their amount locked. This ratio can be determined. 

#### Seller

1. Similar to seller. 

#### Trader

1. Also affected by reputation system and KYC. 

2. Still trying to figure out staking for them...
